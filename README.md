### Frameworks Used

* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Typography

The following [webpage](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/pick-best-font-style-for-website/) was useful in order to decide which font style to select. A display type was chosen due to its friendly accessible approach, and sans-Serif as the backup font.

* 1 [Google Font](https://fonts.google.com/) was used throughout this website: 
- [Patua One](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patua+One?category=Display&sidebar.open&selection.family=DM+Serif+Display|Kaushan+Script|Patua+One)



### Colours

The following [website](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) was useful in order to decide which colours I used for my website.

* <img src="assets/images/readme-color-fawn.png"/> <img src="assets/images/readme-color-tanned.png"/> Navbar
* <img src="assets/images/readme-color-yellow.png"/> Buttons
* <img src="assets/images/readme-color-black.png"/> <img src="assets/images/readme-color-fawn.png"/> Footer
* <img src="assets/images/readme-color-tanned.png"/> <img src="assets/images/readme-color-light-tan.png"/> Donate-Panel

### Icons

* [Font Awesome 5.13.1](https://fontawesome.com/)
    The following 4 Fontawesome icons were used.
    - [map](https://fontawesome.com/icons/map?style=solid) - Used in the Contact Us modal
    - [phone](https://fontawesome.com/icons/phone?style=solid) - Used in the Contact Us modal
    - [mail](https://fontawesome.com/icons/envelope?style=solid) - Used in the Contact Us modal
    - [copyright](https://fontawesome.com/icons/copyright?style=solid) - Used in the footer

### Wireframes

* Click here to see the project [Wireframes](wireframes.md)

### Logo

* Used [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to create the logo by editing [this](https://pixabay.com/vectors/heart-love-cats-kitten-kitty-2766277/) image. The website font from googlefonts was then added to gimp and then inserted underneath the image to create the logo.
