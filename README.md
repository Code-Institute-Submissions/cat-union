# Milestone Project 1

This responsive website was created for Desktop, Tablets and Mobile view. As part of the first milestone project of CodeInstitute's Full Stack Development Course, this was built as a front end static website using HTML, CSS and Bootstrap.

It was created for the fictional charity CatsUnion, and the website is set up to be bright and elegant in order to induce positive emotions in the user to encourage them to want to support the charity.

### CatsUnion

This website is built in order to encourage people to support stray, neglected and abandoned Cats and Kittens.

The main purpose of the page is to make visitors want to sponsor a cat, or to donate to the charity.

In addition, there will be an option to adopt a cat, with a selection of cats to choose from.

### User Stories

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:

As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.
This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

### Typography

The following [link](https://www.websitebuilderexpert.com/designing-websites/pick-best-font-style-for-website/) was visited in order to decide which font style to select.
A display type font was chosen as a way to also invoke friendly and playful emotions within the user. 
The selected display font from [google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Patua+One?category=Display&sidebar.open&selection.family=DM+Serif+Display|Kaushan+Script|Patua+One) was Patua One as it had the most professional looking appearance of what the website needed to portray. 

### Colours

I used the [color wheel](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-wheel/) in order to decide which colours I used for my website.
I chose a shade of pink as my primary colour in order to portray playfulness and happiness that colour psychology suggests. 
I chose the triadic colour combination to have the colours compliment each other but in a bold way. 
The light yellow is an optimal colour for the donate panel as psychology suggest it invokes feeling of optimism and friendliness. Another emotion the page intends to portray. 
I used the complimentary green for the buttons around the pages which works as psychology suggest it gives a sense of positivity, calmness, health and luck encouraging users to press the buttons.

Used [Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) to create my logo by editing [this](https://pixabay.com/vectors/heart-love-cats-kitten-kitty-2766277/) image. The website font from googlefonts was then added to gimp and then inserted underneath the image to create the logo.
